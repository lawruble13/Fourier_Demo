# Fourier Demo

I wrote this in second year, over the course of about 3 days. It was a demonstration for my Signals and Systems class, to show how oscillating waves can make various different waveforms. It exhibits many useful properties, including the Gibbs phenomenon, and additionally has a relatively usable UI.
